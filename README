This code was written for the purpose of completing the second programming assignment
in Professor Raghavendra's EE450 Fall2019 course. All code was written by Everett
Tsang for except for excerpts of tutorial code found from https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/iterators-c-stl/
for the usage of iterating through a map data structure.

The program executes three main methods in its main() function.
These are:
generateGraph() which reads data from a file to create an information structure,
  a vector of nodes containing adjacency information and costs.
dijkstra(int source) which executes the dijkstra's algorithm on the global map variable
  and stores the computed information in a respective node's data structure
  ie distance from source, current shortest path from source node. This method takes
  a single parameter is the source node from which to start the algorithm.
generateRoutingTable(int source) generates the minimum path tree and routing TABLE
  specified in by the parameter (int source). The input to this method must be consistent
  with that of the input to the dijkstra method in order for data to be correctly computed


At first glance, there exists two structures within a node that contain neighboring node information,
one in the form of a map and the other in a vector. These two contain identical information and are both
used in computation.
